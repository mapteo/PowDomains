# PowDomainsSafari

Safari Extension: Configure Safari to treat .dev URLs (Pow top-level domains) as valid domains.

With Safari and Pow I often forget to add the slash ('/') at the end of the URL and Safari tries to search on Google for the text of the URL instead of going to the URL.  
This extension forces Safari to treat .dev domains as valid domains.
